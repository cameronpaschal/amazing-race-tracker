# Project Title (Update)

This project will be used to keep track of and maintain clues for the amazing race. 


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Create a firebase firestore database to store the clues.
2. Create a UI that users can use to query, add, update and delete data from the database.
3. Add further functionality such as a live map, authentication, or creating clue orders. 

Instructions for using the software:

1. Once you have authenticated, click create clue to create a new clue.
2. Input the correct information and then click save.
3. You should now be able to see your clue with the other clues that have been created.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* The only thing that will be required to use the tool is clicking the designated firebase link. 
* If the link is not working, cloning the repository in a file system and using live server can also work to view the functionality. 
* Login can be achieved by using the email: pas23008@byui.edu and the password: AMAZINGRACE

# Project Title (Update)

This project will be used to keep track of and maintain clues for the amazing race. 


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Go to the following link: https://amazingrace-dba125.web.app/ or liveshare the html files using vscode.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Login using the following credentials: email: pas23008@byui.edu password: AMAZINGRACE
2. Once you have authenticated, click create clue to create a new clue.
3. Input the correct information and then click save.
4. You should now be able to see your clue with the other clues that have been created.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* The only thing that will be required to use the tool is clicking the designated firebase link. 
* If the link is not working, cloning the repository in a file system and using live server can also work to view the functionality. 

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* https://firebase.google.com/docs

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add in a map to view clue locations and addresses
* [ ] Add in a more dedicated dashboard where clues can be rearranged
* [ ] Add in a numbering system so clues can be put in order
